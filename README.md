# OSR
Open Source Racing is a project initiated by RENN WAFFEN to digitize the grassroots racing foundation, allowing access to previously restricted resources such as completely custom airfoils and racing components that are otherwise inaccessible for most. 

Open Source Racing is a group effort; in other words, the community that uses these resources also works to contribute and to improve the existing material. 

# What's the Big Idea?

At some point, we've all wished that racing was more accessible, but the reality is that it is the kind of sport in which funding precedes talent. The reason sports like football, baseball, and basketball have such a massive cult following is because a star can be born anywhere as long as they have enough money to purchase a ball or a bat, and the gear required. The rest is up to their talent and/or the amount of time they put into practicing. Sadly, racing is just not the same.

Too many incredibly talented individuals are unable to enter the fray because of the high initial investment. Even Spec Miata - America's most affordable foot in the door to an opportunity into pro racing - can cost dozens of thousands to those who want to remain competitive. This project was created to negate this.

The idea behind Open Source Racing (henceforth OSR) is to use additive manufacturing and various other digital tools - which are becoming exponentially more accessible as time goes on - to develop downloadable parts that would otherwise be inaccessible to most. It will also serve as a foundation to a new future of racing - one in which customizability of components can be taken to new extremes. It will serve to not only help drivers, but also shops who specialize in aerodynamics, chassis reinforcement, and race prep, by making blueprints that can be easily downloaded to be used in a build. As the project grows, prices will shrink - creating more opportunities for those who otherwise wouldn't have any to enter the racing world.

# Resale and Reproduction of Listed Files

The following companies provide high quality components. If you lack any of the necessary tools to make these parts on your own (e.g. you don't have a plywood cutter to cut the O-Katana), please feel free to reach out to any of the following manufacturers.
