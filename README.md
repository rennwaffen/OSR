# OSR
Open Source Racing is a project initiated by RENN WAFFEN to digitize the grassroots racing foundation, allowing access to previously restricted resources such as completely custom airfoils and racing components that are otherwise inaccessible for most. 

Open Source Racing is a group effort; in other words, the community that uses these resources also works to contribute and to improve the existing material. 

# Donations
