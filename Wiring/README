I've been working on open-sourcing parts of the build as a lot of these individual components and mini-projects can add up to thousands of dollars in costs. 
This unfortunately also applies to safety components, and I was taught that wiring is by all means a safety component. 

This diagram/reference table was assembled by my intern under my supervision. The car started and ran fine under this config, 
however we are in the process of modifying it to add dbw.
